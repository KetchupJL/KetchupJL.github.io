Welcome to the first post in my MSc dissertation series, where I explore **quantile-based return forecasting** for Solana mid-cap tokens. This blog documents not only research progress but also the process, code, and reflections as I work toward building **risk-calibrated 72-hour return interval forecasts**.

This is **not** just about "price prediction." It's about estimating the **10th, 50th, and 90th percentile** returns, quantifying **tail risk**, and helping traders or analysts assess the distribution of returns‚Äîespecially under high volatility and skewed conditions typical in DeFi.

## üì° What This Project Is All About

In volatile crypto markets, especially for thinly traded mid-cap tokens, traditional models often break. This project focuses on forecasting not just a point estimate, but an **interval**‚Äîlike this:

> **Predicted 72h Return Interval:**
> - 10th percentile: -12.3%  
> - 50th percentile (median): +1.4%  
> - 90th percentile: +16.7%

With these, we can answer questions like:
- How bad could things get in the next 3 days?
- Is this an unusually asymmetric return distribution?
- How wide is the uncertainty‚Äîshould we size down?

My core model is the **Quantile Regression Forest (QRF)**, compared against two baselines:
1. **Linear Quantile Regression**
2. **LightGBM + Bootstrap Intervals**

## üß± Data Collection: From Raw to Structured

I gathered data for **23 Solana tokens** that meet the criteria of ‚â•$50M market cap and ‚â•3 months listing age.

### ‚úÖ What I Managed to Collect

**12-Hour Aggregated Streams:**

- OHLCV bars (per token)
- Wallet count growth
- Transfer count
- New token accounts

**Global Context Features:**

- SOL/USD price (OHLCV)
- ETH, BTC prices
- Solana DeFi TVL
- Solana transaction counts
- SPL program instruction counts

üìå *I could not obtain reliable sentiment data (e.g., Twitter or Telegram mentions), despite trying multiple sources and scraping attempts. I may explore [LunarCrush](https://lunarcrush.com/) later.*

## üì∏ Visual Snapshot of the Dataset

*üñºÔ∏è Add a placeholder for a heatmap or EDA graphic showing token coverage over time, wallet activity, or a simple line chart of SOL price.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Feature Engineering

Using 12h data, I engineered features capturing momentum, volatility, liquidity, and network activity.
