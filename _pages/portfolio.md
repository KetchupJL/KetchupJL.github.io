# Projects & Research

A collection of applied and technical work, from **algorithmic trading systems** and **on-chain analytics** to **academic data science research**.

---

## üîÅ Trading Systems & Blockchain Analytics

*Live trading systems and alpha discovery research in Solana markets, combining real-time blockchain data with algorithmic strategies.*

### Dex-Paid Alpha Signal Bot *(Closed Source, Live Trading)*

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Live_Success-green) ![Tools](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tools-TypeScript%2C%20FastAPI%2C%20PostgreSQL%2C%20Solana-informational)
**Production-grade Solana trading system** built in TypeScript, designed for ultra-low latency detection of Dex-Paid tokens and smart alpha-based entries.

* Actively running live with consistent profitability on low-cap Solana tokens
* Integrates SolanaTracker, DexScreener, and Helius APIs for deep market microstructure insights
* Features wallet clustering, liquidity heuristics, and rug-pull detection
* Built with concurrency optimisations, request throttling, and structured logging
* Sends **real-time trade alerts** to Discord and manages positions with configurable exit strategies

*(Closed-source, private system actively trading.)*

### [Quantile Regression Forests for Solana Returns (Research Paper)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395025657_Interval_Forecasting_of_Cryptocurrency_Returns_using_Quantile_Regression_Forests_An_Application_to_the_Solana_Ecosystem)

![Tools](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tools-Python%2C%20LightGBM%2C%20QuantReg-informational)
Peer-reviewed MSc dissertation on **interval forecasting of Solana token returns** using Quantile Regression Forests (QRF).

* Developed a robust forecasting framework for 72-hour return intervals
* Benchmarked against linear quantile regression, and LightGBM baselines
* Tail risk calibration and coverage efficiency analysis
* Applied interpretable ML to real-world Solana token data
* Published on **ResearchGate**
