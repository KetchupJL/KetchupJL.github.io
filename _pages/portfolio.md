## 🔁 Trading Systems & Blockchain Analytics

### [MLTradingBot](https://github.com/KetchupJL/Trading-Bot)
![Tools](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tools-Python%2C%20REST%20API%2C%20Solana-informational)
> Fully automated pipeline for **alpha signal ingestion**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, and **execution logic**. Real-time system that logs indicators, tracks token trajectories, and pushes alerts for low-cap Solana tokens.  
**Key Features**: OHLCV parsing, LightGBM classification, live backtesting, Discord notifications, Dex Screener & SolanaTracker integration.

### [Solana Alpha Signal Tracker](https://github.com/KetchupJL/Trading-Bot)
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live_Trades-✓-success) ![Tools](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tools-TypeScript%2C%20FastAPI%2C%20PostgreSQL-informational)  
> Rebuilt signal bot in **TypeScript** for higher concurrency. Tracks token metadata, market cap growth, and volume trends post-DEX listing.  
**Highlights**: Converted $20 → $4,000 in 5 weeks in live simulation, running advanced heuristics (wallet clustering, liquidity traps, rug-pull detection).

### [QRF Forecasting of Mid-Cap Solana Returns](https://github.com/KetchupJL/solana-qrf-interval-forecasting) *(MSc Dissertation — Ongoing)*
![Tools](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tools-Python%2C%20LightGBM%2C%20QuantReg%2C%20CCXT-informational)
> Predicting 72-hour return intervals on mid-cap Solana tokens using **Quantile Regression Forests** and **bootstrapped LightGBM**. Benchmarked with statistical baselines and volatility-sensitive metrics.  
**Outcome**: Research-grade ML forecasting framework with tail risk calibration and token-specific feature interpretation.
