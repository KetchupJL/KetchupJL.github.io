## Hey, I'm James Lewis

I'm a Data Science MSc student (80% avg, graduating Aug 2025) with a background in Economics. I live and breathe data — from statistical modeling to blockchain analytics, I apply quantitative methods to uncover edge and build systems that learn from data in real time.

Over the past year, I’ve:

- Built and deployed **live Solana trading bots**
- Turned a **$20 test wallet into $4,000 in 5 weeks** using my first alpha signal
- Developed interpretable **ML pipelines for price forecasting**
- Created projects ranging from **ecology and health to finance and DeFi**

## 💡 I’m Interested In...

- Quantitative research and signal discovery
- Real-time analytics and crypto infrastructure
- Predictive modeling and statistical learning
- Automating trading decisions using AI

## 🧠 Competitive Mindset

I've competed at a high level in:

- 🎮 Strategy games: Command & Conquer, Total War and other games.
- 🏉 Sports: Rugby, Olympic Weightlifting, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu

I thrive in high-stakes environments where edge matters.
