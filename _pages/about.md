## Hey, I'm James Lewis

Iâ€™m a Data Science MSc graduate (distinction) with a background in Economics, now focused on **quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, and crypto research**. My work combines academic rigour with live market deployment.

Over the past year, Iâ€™ve:

* **Built and deployed live Solana trading bots** â€” including a Dex-Paid Signal Bot that monitors new mints, detects approval events in real time, and executes tiered strategies in both paper and live trading.
* **Discovered novel on-chain alpha signals** by analysing wallet behaviour, liquidity events, and market microstructure.
* **Written research on Quantile Return Forecasting in crypto**, bridging advanced statistical models with trading applications.
* Delivered projects across domains from **finance and DeFi** to **health and ecology**, always with a data-driven, research-oriented approach.

## ðŸ’¡ What Drives Me

* Building and refining **algorithmic trading systems**
* Exploring **quant research in crypto** and market microstructure
* Applying **machine learning and AI** to real-time trading problems
* Engineering strategies designed to **beat the market with data**

## ðŸ§  Competitive Mindset

I thrive where edge matters. That shows up in both work and play:

* Strategy games (Command & Conquer, Total War, League of Legends)
* Rugby, Olympic Weightlifting, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu

In trading as in sport, I focus on discipline, adaptability, and constant iteration.
